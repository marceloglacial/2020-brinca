Adding menus endpoints on WP REST API v2

== Description ==

This plugin extends the [WordPress REST API (Version 2)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/) with new routes for WordPress registered menus.

The new routes available will be:

* `/menus/v1/menus/<slug>` data for a specific menu.
* `/menus/v1/locations` list of every registered menu location in your theme.
* `/menus/v1/locations/<slug>` data for a specific menu location.

Compatible with ACF menu's custom attributes and menu item's custom attributes.

Compatible with [Menu Image, Icons made easy](https://wordpress.org/plugins/menu-image/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-rest-api-v2-menus` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
